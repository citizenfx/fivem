# Building Cfx.re

## Generate solution

To build FiveM, RedM or FXServer on Windows you need the following dependencies:

* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community edition or higher) including the following:
  - Workloads
    - .NET desktop development
    - Desktop development with C++
    - Windows application development
  - Individual components
    - .NET Framework 4.6 targeting pack
    - Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22000.0)
  
  You can install these workloads by going to "Tools" -> "Get Tools and Features..." -> Check the checkboxes -> Click "Modify" in the bottom right corner.
  
* [PowerShell 7](https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable) or higher.
* [Python 3.8 or higher](https://python.org/) with the `py` launcher installed.
* [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) at `C:\msys64\` which is where the installer places it.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) in your PATH as `node` and `yarn`.

Then, execute the following commands in a `cmd.exe` shell to set up the build environment:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem.git -c core.symlinks=true
cd fivem
git submodule update --jobs=16 --init

:: if you're using Python 3.12 or higher make sure you install the setuptools package
pip install setuptools

:: downloads the right Chrome version for 64-bit projects
fxd get-chrome

:: build bindings of game natives.
prebuild

:: or -game server/-game rdr3
fxd gen -game five
fxd vs -game five
```

### Set up data files for `five`

After building the FiveM client, you should be having files such as `/code/bin/five/debug/v8.dll` exist automatically. Manual copying is no longer required.

**Symlink `game-storage` directory** (optional)

The `code\bin\five\debug\data\game-storage` directory can get quite large and is equivalent to the `%LocalAppData%\FiveM\FiveM.app\data\game-storage` directory, so you should use a **symlink** to save disk space.

If you don't know how to do that, here's how:

1. Navigate to `code\bin\five\debug` in your `fivem` source repository.
2. Make a new `data` directory if it doesn't already exist.
3. Delete the `game-storage` folder in `data` if it already exists.
4. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>, right click empty space while in `code\bin\five\debug\data`, and select "Open PowerShell window here".
5. Type in the following commands:
   ```
   cmd
   mklink /d game-storage "%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\data\game-storage"
   ```
6. You should now see a `game-storage` folder inside `code\bin\five\debug\data`.

**Known issues**

- Game starts but all I see is the main menu background, my cursor and (when I press F8) a console!
  
  This directory is probably missing: `/code/bin/five/debug/citizen/ui`.
  
  UI building might have failed, but you can copy this directory `%LocalAppData%/FiveM/FiveM.app/citizen/ui` from your main installation of FiveM.
- Windows error code 126, or some issues with other DLLs.

  It's possible that you accidentally missed a step or skipped a file that should have been copied. Start this section over from scratch; do not pass go, do not collect Â£200.

- Windows error code 127.

  Add an antivirus exclusion for the repository, try rebuilding, and see if it works this time.
  
- error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'API' does not exist in the namespace 'CitizenFX.Core.Native' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
- error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Hash' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

  `fxd gen` ran before `prebuild`. Close the solution, re-run `fxd gen` and then reopen & build the solution again.
