// A Remote is used to issue Interface method calls to a single connected
// Receiver or PendingReceiver. The Remote must be bound in order to issue those
// method calls, and it becomes bound by consuming a PendingRemote either at
// construction time or by calling |Bind()|.
//
// Remote is NOT thread- or sequence-safe and must be used on a single
// (but otherwise arbitrary) sequence. All bound Remote objects are associated
// with a base::SequenceTaskRunner which the Remote uses exclusively to schedule
// response callbacks and disconnection notifications.
//
// The most common ways to bind a Remote are to consume a PendingRemote received
// via some IPC, or to call |BindNewPipeAndPassReceiver()| and send the returned
// PendingReceiver somewhere useful (i.e., to a remote Receiver who will consume
// it). For example:
//
//     mojo::Remote<mojom::Widget> widget;
//     widget_factory->CreateWidget(widget.BindNewPipeAndPassReceiver());
//     widget->Click();
//
// IMPORTANT: There are some things to be aware of regarding Interface method
// calls as they relate to Remote object lifetime:
//
//   - Interface method calls issued immediately before the destruction of a
//     Remote ARE guaranteed to be transmitted to the remote's receiver as long
//     as the receiver itself remains alive, either as a Receiver or a
//     PendingReceiver.
//
//   - In the name of memory safety, Interface method response callbacks (and in
//     general ANY tasks which can be scheduled by a Remote) will NEVER
//     be dispatched beyond the lifetime of the Remote object. As such, if
//     you make a call and you need its reply, you must keep the Remote alive
//     until the reply is received.
