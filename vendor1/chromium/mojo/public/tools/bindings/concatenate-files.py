# This utility concatenates several files into one. On Unix-like systems
# it is equivalent to:
#   cat file1 file2 file3 ...files... > target
#
# The reason for writing a separate utility is that 'cat' is not available
# on all supported build platforms, but Python is, and hence this provides
# us with an easy and uniform way of doing this on all platforms.

# for py2/py3 compatibility
