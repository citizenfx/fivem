//
// I wanted to put a funny story here, but this issue is pretty sad.
//
// Basically, AMD's 'Crimson' driver release ('15.11', not to be confused with 'Catalyst 15.11.1' which is actually an older branch) caused crashes in
// the D3D11 UMD for a typical VNGta scenario, on a background thread used for *whatever* processing.
//
// In a day-ish, this turned into the second most common crash in the crash statistics, affecting pretty much everyone with an AMD GPU who bothers
// to update their drivers.
//
// Of course, as there's no debugging symbols, RTTI nor even a bug reporting forum (Intel at least has the latter), and common stories exist of
// AMD/ATi not fixing bugs reported by small developers until *years* later, let alone an 'unauthorized' game modification, there was theoretically
// 'nothing' I could do.
//
// However, simply try/catching the memmove call that tries to write to a 'corrupted' address seems to work reliably to fix this crash (if there were RTTI
// I could've found out what exactly crashes, but of course there isn't), and it only seems to be invoked around twice in the game's runtime, so it doesn't
// really affect performance.
//
// Of course, if AMD doesn't fix this issue, and yet changes the function's pattern/the used compiler (from 15.11.1 to 15.11 the function's register allocation
// changed a *lot* already!), this workaround will come back to bite us in the future.
//
// For now, it works, though, so that'd make the users (and me, as I use a GCN GPU myself as well, at the time of this writing) happy.
//
