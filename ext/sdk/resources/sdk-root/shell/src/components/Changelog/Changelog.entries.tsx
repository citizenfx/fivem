        <ul>
          <li>
            Fix most cases of EPERM while deleting/renaming folders, but not all of them:
            <ul>
              <li>
                tsserver of typescript-language-features ext of theia is still using node's broken file watcher
                so it will still EPERM if deleting/renaming folder containing tsconfig.json, rip
              </li>
              <li>
                omnisharp of csharp-language-features ext of theia will also block deleting/renaming of folder with cs resource, rip
              </li>

            <br/>
            This is due to a big amount of unforeseen edge-cases that sometimes cause viewer to be completely broken.
