developed by: Einar Lielmanis, <einar@beautifier.io>\n    https://beautifier.io/\n\n  Usage:\n    style_html(html_source);\n\n    style_html(html_source, options);\n\n  The options are:\n    indent_inner_html (default false)  — indent <head> and <body> sections,\n    indent_size (default 4)          — indentation size,\n    indent_char (default space)      — character to indent with,\n    wrap_line_length (default 250)            -  maximum amount of characters per line (0 = disable)\n    brace_style (default \"collapse\") - \"collapse\" | \"expand\" | \"end-expand\" | \"none\"\n            put braces on the same line as control statements (default), or put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style), or just put end braces on own line, or attempt to keep them where they are.\n    inline (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags to be considered inline tags\n    unformatted (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags, that shouldn't be reformatted\n    content_unformatted (defaults to [\"pre\", \"textarea\"] tags) - list of tags, whose content shouldn't be reformatted\n    indent_scripts (default normal)  - \"keep\"|\"separate\"|\"normal\"\n    preserve_newlines (default true) - whether existing line breaks before elements should be preserved\n                                        Only works before elements, not inside tags or for text.\n    max_preserve_newlines (default unlimited) - maximum number of line breaks to be preserved in one chunk\n    indent_handlebars (default false) - format and indent {{#foo}} and {{/foo}}\n    end_with_newline (false)          - end with a newline\n    extra_liners (default [head,body,/html]) -List of tags that should have an extra newline before them.\n\n    e.g.\n\n    style_html(html_source, {\n      'indent_inner_html': false,\n      'indent_size': 2,\n      'indent_char': ' ',\n      'wrap_line_length': 78,\n      'brace_style': 'expand',\n      'preserve_newlines': true,\n      'max_preserve_newlines': 5,\n

HTML5 specification urges authors to omit the attribute rather than provide a redundant MIME type. In earlier browsers, this identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code. JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types).\\n*   **`module`:** For HTML5-compliant browsers the code is treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is not affected by the `charset` and `defer` attributes. For information on using `module`, see [ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/). Code may behave differently when the `module` keyword is used.\\n*   **Any other value:** The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. The `src` attribute will be ignored.\\n\\n**Note:** in Firefox you could specify the version of JavaScript contained in a `<script>` element by including a non-standard `version` parameter inside the `type` attribute — for example `type=\\\"text/javascript;version=1.8\\\"`.

An offset path is either a specified path with one or multiple sub-paths or the geometry of a not-styled basic shape. Each shape or path must define an initial position for the computed value of \\\"0\\\" for offset-distance and an initial direction which specifies the rotation of the object to the initial position.\\n\\nIn this specification, a direction (or rotation) of 0 degrees is equivalent to the direction of the positive x-axis in the object’s local coordinate system. In other words, a rotation of 0 degree points to the right side of the UA if the object and its ancestors have no transformation applied.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"offset-rotate\",\n            \"syntax\": \"[ auto | reverse ] || <angle>\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"E79\",\n                \"FF72\",\n                \"C56\",\n                \"O43\"\n            ],\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/offset-rotate\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"The offset-rotate CSS property defines the direction of the element while positioning along the offset path.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"offset-distance\",\n            \"syntax\": \"<length-percentage>\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"E79\",\n                \"FF72\",\n                \"C55\",\n                \"O42\"\n            ],\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/offset-distance\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"The offset-distance CSS property specifies a position along an offset-path.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"transform-box\",\n            \"syntax\": \"border-box | fill-box | view-box\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"E79\",\n                \"FF55\",\n                \"S11\",\n                \"C64\",\n                \"O51\"\n            ],\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/transform-box\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"The transform-box CSS property defines the layout box to which the transform and transform-origin properties relate.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"place-items\",\n            \"syntax\": \"<'align-items'> <'justify-items'>?\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"E79\",\n                \"FF45\",\n                \"S11\",\n                \"C59\",\n                \"O46\"\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"The CSS place-items shorthand property sets both the align-items and justify-items properties.
