## What is this extension? Do I need it?

TL;DR: If you are running `VS Code`, `Code OSS` or derived product built from the VS Code repository, such as [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), you do not need to install this extension since it's already present - "built-in".

Built-in extensions are built-along and included in `VS Code` and `Code OSS`. In consequence they may be expected to be present and used by other extensions. They are part of the [vscode GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/) and generally contribute basic functionality such as textmate grammars, used for syntax-highlighting, for some of the most popular programming languages. In some cases, more substantial features are contributed through built-in extensions (e.g. Typescript, Markdown, git, ...). Please see the description above to learn what this specific extension does.
