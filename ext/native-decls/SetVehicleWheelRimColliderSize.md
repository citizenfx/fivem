## SET_VEHICLE_WHEEL_RIM_COLLIDER_SIZE

```c
void SET_VEHICLE_WHEEL_RIM_COLLIDER_SIZE(Vehicle vehicle, int wheelIndex, float value);
```

Not sure what this changes, probably determines physical rim size in case the tire is blown.

## Parameters
* **vehicle**: The vehicle to obtain data for.
* **wheelIndex**: Index of wheel, 0-3.
* **value**: Size of rim collider.
