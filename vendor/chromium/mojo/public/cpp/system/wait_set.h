// WaitSet maintains some persistent accounting of the handles added or removed
// from the set. A blocking wait operation (see  the Wait() method  below) can
// then be performed multiple times for the same set of events and handles with
// minimal additional setup per call.

// WaitSet is NOT thread-safe, so naturally handles and events may not be added

  // storage for |*num_ready_handles| MojoHandleSignalsState structures.

  // Upon return, |*num_ready_handles| will contain the total number of handles
  // whose information is stored in the given output buffers.

  // If |ready_event| is non-null and the Wait() was unblocked by a user event
  // signaling, the address of the event which signaled will be placed in

  // handles also being ready. If |ready_event| is non-null and no user event
  // was signaled for this Wait(), |*ready_event| will be null upon return.

  // Every entry in |ready_handles| on output corresponds to one of the handles
  // whose signaling state termianted the Wait() operation. Every corresponding
  // entry in |ready_results| indicates the status of a ready handle according
  // to the following result codes:
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_OK| one or more signals for the handle has been satisfied.
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_FAILED_PRECONDITION| all of the signals for the handle have
  //       become permanently unsatisfiable.
  //   |MOJO_RESULT_CANCELLED| if the handle has been closed from another
  //       sequence. NOTE: It is important to recognize that this means the
  //       corresponding value in |ready_handles| is either invalid, or valid
  //       but referring to a different handle (i.e. has already been reused) by
  //       the time Wait() returns. The handle in question is automatically
  //       removed from the WaitSet.
